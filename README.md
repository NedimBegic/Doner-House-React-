<h1>Doner House </h1>
<h2>Why I did this project ?<h2>
<p>Made it to practice state menagment with useContext hook and useReducer. It should be a simple web app for ordering food. <br> Some styles are not the same for every mobile phone and I did't want to overinvest beacause I have to make the next step in learning React. </p>
<h2>What I learned in this project: </h2>
<ul>
<li>I learned that you never mutate an object in React but I never knew why till I didnâ€™t lose two days because my useReducer triggered twice. It should decrease a number by one insted it decresed by two.instead</li>
<li>useContext and useReducer for more complex states</li>
<li>build a slider that switches images with animations in the background with useEffect hook, conditional styling and setTimeOut Web Api</li>
</ul>
